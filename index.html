                                Hello everyone! My name is Keiana Hanson, but a lot of people just call me
                                "Kiki." I just
                                turned 26, live on Long Island in New York and I am a beginner coder/developer.
                                In 2016, I graduated from Binghamton University with my Bachelor of Arts with a major in
                                Creative Writing and a minor in Cinema. As a child, I’ve always been creative – from
                                writing
                                “fanfictions” about my favorite characters from movies and shows, to creating ridiculous
                                skits and short movies with my college a capella group, I’ve always wanted to be
                                creative
                                for
                                a living.
                                <br><br> When I graduated from college, I really wanted to express my creativity as a
                                video editor. I
                                even had an externship through Binghamton with Showtime Network in Los Angeles,
                                California,
                                and for a week I was able to speak with executives, assistants, and interns from
                                California
                                universities; I got to review unreleased content and scripts, sit in on meetings and
                                truly
                                see how the network operated from an administrational standpoint. <br><br>
                                The summer of 2016, I applied to countless PA (production assistant) positions, both
                                locally and
                                nationally, but to my dismay, many of them advised me that because of my lack of
                                experience
                                and
                                exposure in the television industry, they could not offer me a job.
                                <br><br>Fast forward four years, and presently, I came across a non-profit group called
                                Woman Who Code,
                                and it changed my life. Seeing so many women of diverse backgrounds inspired me to
                                pursue coding.
                                I enrolled in Columbia University’s Fullstack Coding Boot Camp so I may develop the
                                skill set to become a software developer and bring my ideas to light in the medium of
                                video games.
                                <br><br> This post-grad journey has been confusing, and I’ve had many moments where I
                                felt lost, but I
                                am forever grateful for the journey nonetheless, as it has led me to this point in my
                                life
                                and I’m excited to see where I end up.
